        # CreateTable
            # Creates a new table. Optionally, you can create one or more secondary indexes, and enable DynamoDB Streams 
            # for the table.
        # DescribeTable
            # Returns information about a table, such as its primary key schema, throughput settings, and index information.
        # ListTables
            # Returns the names of all of your tables in a list.
        # UpdateTable
            # Modifies the settings of a table or its indexes, creates or removes new indexes on a table, or modifies 
            # DynamoDB Streams settings for a table.
        # DeleteTable
            # Removes a table and all of its dependent objects from DynamoDB.
    # Creating data
        # PutItem
            # Writes a single item to a table. You must specify the primary key attributes, but you don't have to specify 
            # other attributes.
        # BatchWriteItem
            # Writes up to 25 items to a table. This is more efficient than calling PutItem multiple times because your 
            # application only needs a single network round trip to write the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for 
            # deleting multiple items from one or more tables.
            # Up to 16MB of data written, up to 400 KB of data per item
            # Can't update items
    # Reading data
        # GetItem
            # Retrieves a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want. You can 
            # retrieve the entire item, or just a subset of its attributes.
        # BatchGetItem
            # Retrieves up to 100 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling GetItem multiple times 
            # because your application only needs a single network round trip to read the items.
            # Returns items from one or more tables
            # Up to 100 items, up to 16 MB of data
            # Items are retrived in parallel to minimize latency
        # Query
            # Retrieves all items that have a specific partition key. You must specify the partition key value. You can 
            # retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a condition to the sort 
            # key values so that you only retrieve a subset of the data that has the same partition key. You can use this 
            # operation on a table, provided that the table has both a partition key and a sort key. You can also use this 
            # operation on an index, provided that the index has both a partition key and a sort key.
            # Returns items based on key conditions 
            # Filter expressions for query
                # If you need to further refine the Query results, you can optionally provide a filter expression. A filter 
                # expression determines which items within the Query results should be returned to you. All of the other 
                # results are discarded.
        # Scan
            # Retrieves all items in the specified table or index. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of 
            # their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a filtering condition to return only the values that you are 
            # interested in and discard the rest.
            # For faster performance, use Parallel Scan
            # Use filter and projected expressions to refine results
        # projection expression
            # To get only some, rather than all of the attributes, use a projection expression.A projection expression is 
            # a string that identifies the attributes that you want. To retrieve a single attribute, specify its name. 
            # For multiple attributes, the names must be comma-separated.

    # Updating data
        #UpdateItem
            # Modifies one or more attributes in an item. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to 
            # modify. You can add new attributes and modify or remove existing attributes. You can also perform conditional 
            # updates, so that the update is only successful when a user-defined condition is met. Optionally, you can 
            # implement an atomic counter, which increments or decrements a numeric attribute without interfering with 
            # other write requests.
    # Deleting data
        # DeleteItem
            # Deletes a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to delete.
            # BatchWriteItem
                # Deletes up to 25 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling DeleteItem multiple 
                # times because your application only needs a single network round trip to delete the items. You can also 
                # use BatchWriteItem for adding multiple items to one or more tables.

    # DynamoDB Streams
        # DynamoDB Streams operations let you enable or disable a stream on a table, and allow access to the data 
        # modification records contained in a stream.
            # ListStreams
                # Returns a list of all your streams, or just the stream for a specific table.
            # DescribeStream
                # Returns information about a stream, such as its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and where your application 
                # can begin reading the first few stream records.
            # GetShardIterator
                # Returns a shard iterator, which is a data structure that your application uses to retrieve the records 
                # from the stream.
            # GetRecords
                # Retrieves one or more stream records, using a given shard iterator.
    # Filtering
        # Filtering can only be done client sude
        # We can scan and then filter
        # We can queuery and then filter
