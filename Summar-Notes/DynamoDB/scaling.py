# Scaling
    # DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that can support tables of virtually any size with horizontal scaling. 
    # This enables DynamoDB to scale to more than 10 trillion requests per day with peaks greater than 20 million requests 
    # per second, over petabytes of storage.
