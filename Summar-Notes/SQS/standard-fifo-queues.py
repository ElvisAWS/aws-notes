# Standard-Queue
    # Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API 
    # calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support 
    # at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that 
    # allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard 
    # queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as 
    # they're sent.
# Fifo-Queueus
    # FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues have all the capabilities of the standard queues, but are designed to 
    # enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates 
    # can't be tolerated.
    # FIFO queues also provide exactly-once processing, but have a limited number of transactions per second (TPS). 
    # You can use Amazon SQS high throughput mode with your FIFO queue to increase your transaction limit.
    # Limited throughput due to the ordering constrain
    # 300 msg/s without batching and 3000 msg/s with batching
    # Exactly-once send capability (by removing duplicates)
    # Queue naming should end with .fifo
    # Message group ID: This specifies a message belongs to a particular group
    # Message deduplication ID: The token used for deduplication messages within the deduplication interval
    # Content-based deduplication: this will set message id to optional when enabled
