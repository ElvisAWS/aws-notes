# This client library helps us send messages that are greater than 256kb
# Its a Java library and can be implemented in many languages
# The large message will be stored in S3, this client library will create 
# meta-data message pointers and insert them into the queue pointing to the large message in the bucket.
# When the consumer reads the small meta-data messages, they will be re-directed to read the large messages 
# in the S3 bucket
