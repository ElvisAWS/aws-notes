# This is the option for consumers to wait for messages to arrive in the queue if there are no messages in the queue
# LongPoling decreases the number of API calls being made
# LongPooling can be set between 1-20 secs wait
# This can be enabled at the queue level or at the API level using WaitTimeSeconds
# This reduces latency as the message is immediately polled by the consumer upon arrival
