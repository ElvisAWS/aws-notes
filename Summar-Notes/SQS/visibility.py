# Message visibility timeout
    # After a message is viewed by a consumer, it becomes invisible from other consumers. 
    # Visibility timeout is 30 seconds by default
    # The message will be returned to the queue if its not consumed and deleted in this time period
    # If the message is not consumed it might be consumed twice
    # If a consumer can not consume a message in the 30 seconds time periuod, then use the ChangeMessageVisibility API to change this
    # visibility timeout with a meaningful timeout.
    # You can also set this visibility timeout on the console
    #
