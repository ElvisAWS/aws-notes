# Lambda execution role
     # A Lambda function's execution role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that grants the function permission 
     # to access AWS services and resources. For example, you might create an execution role that has permission to send logs to 
     # Amazon CloudWatch and upload trace data to AWS X-Ray.
     # You provide an execution role when you create a function. When you invoke your function, Lambda automatically provides your 
     # function with temporary credentials by assuming this role. You don't have to call sts:AssumeRole in your function code.

# Identity-based IAM policies for Lambda
    # You can use identity-based policies in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant users in your account access to Lambda. 
    # Identity-based policies can apply to users directly, or to groups and roles that are associated with a user. You can also grant 
    # users in another account permission to assume a role in your account and access your Lambda resources.
# Resource-based policies for Lambda
    # Lambda supports resource-based permissions policies for Lambda functions and layers. Resource-based policies let you grant usage 
    # permission to other AWS accounts or organizations on a per-resource basis. You also use a resource-based policy to allow an AWS 
    # service to invoke your function on your behalf.
