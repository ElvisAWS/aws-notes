# Lambda Layer 
    # works very similarly to a folder containing a library in a function code. The difference is that, instead 
    # of having to package this library within the function code, it can be packaged separately. Lambda will load 
    # the Layer together with the function when it’s invoked.
        # Re-use code across multiple functions
            # Isolating common features in Layers makes it easier to share the same codebase across multiple 
            # functions. This avoids having to replicate the same code in different places, which is a bad practice
        # Keeping function’s package code smaller
            # Having a large codebase per function can be a problem. It can make it more difficult to maintain and 
            # test the application, for example. It can make deployment slower as well.
        # Simplifies management and deployment of the main function
            # By keeping the function’s package smaller, deployment times are faster. When using large dependencies, 
            # the main function code may have only a couple of megabytes, while the entire package ends up with up to 
            # 50 MB.
        # Dependencies do not change so why not keep them in external layers
