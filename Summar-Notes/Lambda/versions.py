# Lambda versions
    # When we work on a lambda funcion, we work on latest ($LATEST)
    # When we publish, we create a version
    # The new version is immutable (You can not change it)
# Lambda Aliases
    # Aliases are pointers to Lambda function versions
    # We can define a dev, test aliases and have them point to different lambda versions
    # Aliases are mutable
    # We can use Aliases for Blu-Green deployments using weights
