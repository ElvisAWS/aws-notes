# You can now configure a dead letter queue (DLQ) on AWS Lambda to give you more control over message handling 
# for all asynchronous invocations, including those delivered via AWS events (S3, SNS, IoT, etc). You can setup 
# a DLQ by configuring the 'DeadLetterConfig' property when creating or updating your Lambda function. You can 
# provide an SQS queue or an SNS topic as the 'TargetArn' for your DLQ, and AWS Lambda will write the event 
# object invoking the Lambda function to this endpoint after the standard retry policy (2 additional retries 
# on failure) is exhausted.
