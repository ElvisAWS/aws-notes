# AWS Lambda
    # Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs 
    # your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute 
    # resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, 
    # and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service.
