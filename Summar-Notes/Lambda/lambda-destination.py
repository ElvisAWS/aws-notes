# Asynchronous invocations
    # When a function is invoked asynchronously, Lambda sends the event to an internal queue. A separate process 
    # reads events from the queue and executes your Lambda function. When the event is added to the queue, Lambda 
    # previously only returned a 2xx status code to confirm that the queue has received this event. There was no 
    # additional information to confirm whether the event had been processed successfully.

    # With Destinations, you can route asynchronous function results as an execution record to a destination 
    # resource without writing additional code. An execution record contains details about the request and response 
    # in JSON format including version, timestamp, request context, request payload, response context, and response 
    # payload. For each execution status such as Success or Failure you can choose one of four destinations: 
    # another Lambda function, SNS, SQS, or EventBridge. Lambda can also be configured to route different execution 
    # results to different destinations.

    # Allows for both success and failure
