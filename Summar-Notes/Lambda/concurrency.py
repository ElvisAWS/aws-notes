# There are two types of concurrency controls available:
    # Reserved concurrency
        # Reserved concurrency guarantees the maximum number of concurrent instances for the function. When a 
        # function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. There is no charge for 
        # configuring reserved concurrency for a function.
    # Provisioned concurrency
        # Provisioned concurrency initializes a requested number of execution environments so that they are prepared 
        # to respond immediately to your function's invocations. Note that configuring provisioned concurrency incurs 
        # charges to your AWS account.
