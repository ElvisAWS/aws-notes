# If ur function depends on external liabraries, u need to install the packages along side your code and zip them 
# all together
# Upload the zip file if less than 50MB else to S3
# Native liabraries work but they need to be compile on amazon linux
    # Cloud formation
        # You can create Lambda functions by using cloudformation templates but for very simple functions as this
        # template does not reference dependencies
    # Cloud formation through S3
        # Store Lambda zip in S3
        # Refer the S3 zip location in the CloudFormation code
            # S3Bucket
            # S3Key:full path to zip
            # S3objectVersion:if bucket is versioned (Versioning is very important so that if you update the file
            # and specify the new version, cloudformation will pick up the new change)
    # Lambda and Cloud formation- through S3 multiple accounts
        # If we have an S3 bucket with Lambda code in account 1, we can add account 2 and 3 as principles in the 
        # bucket policy
        # Create Cloud formation templates in account 2,3 and add lambda execution roles for S3 account 1
