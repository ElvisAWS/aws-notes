# Lambda in VPC
    # Lambda lunches lambda in another VPC owned by AWS and not on ur default VPC
    # Lambda thus, can't access resources in ur VPC but can access resources such as Dynamodb located in the 
    # AWS VPC.
    # VPC access
        # Define VPC ID, Subnet and security group
        # Lambda creates an ENI in ur subnets
        # AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole
        # Lambda goes through the ENI to access resources in ur VPC subnets
    # Deploying a Lambda funcion in a public subnet does not give it internet access or public IP
    # Deploy in a private subnet and attach a NATGateway to it
    # Use a NAT device to access Dynamodb or VPC endpoint
    # CloudWatch logs will work no matter were the Lambda function is hosted
