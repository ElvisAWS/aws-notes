    # Users can login using cognito
    # Login using federated identities
    # Resert user credentials
    # Set up MFA
    # Login sends back JWT token
    # Integrates with API Gateway and ALB
        # Authenticate users using your ALB before sending them to the backend
    # A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. With a user pool, your users can sign in to your web 
    # or mobile app through Amazon Cognito, or federate through a third-party identity provider (IdP). Whether 
    # your users sign in directly or through a third party, all members of the user pool have a directory profile 
    # that you can access through an SDK.
    # User pools provide:
        # Sign-up and sign-in services.
        # A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users.
        # Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, and through 
        # SAML and OIDC identity providers from your user pool.
        # User directory management and user profiles.
        # Security features such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, 
        # account takeover protection, and phone and email verification.
        # Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.
