# Cognito
    # Amazon Cognito provides authentication, authorization, and user management for your web and mobile apps. 
    # Your users can sign in directly with a user name and password, or through a third party such as Facebook, 
    # Amazon, Google or Apple.
    # The two main components of Amazon Cognito are user pools and identity pools. User pools are user directories 
    # that provide sign-up and sign-in options for your app users. Identity pools enable you to grant your users 
    # access to other AWS services. You can use identity pools and user pools separately or together.
    # An Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool used together
        # In the first step your app user signs in through a user pool and receives user pool tokens after a 
        # successful authentication.
        # Next, your app exchanges the user pool tokens for AWS credentials through an identity pool.
        # Finally, your app user can then use those AWS credentials to access other AWS services such as 
        # Amazon S3 or DynamoDB.
