# Consumers (Classic Fan-Out-Consumer)
    # Gets data record from streams and process them
    # Consumers could be:
        # Lambda functions
        # Kinesis Data Analytics
        # Kinesis Data Firehose
        # Custom consumer
        # Kinesis Client Library
    # Get requests of 2MB/Sec
    # GetRecords API
    # Pull method: Consumer pulls from Kinesis
    # Max 5 GetRecord API calls
    # Latency 200
    # retries
    # Returns up to 10MB then throttles for 5 seconds
    # Many consumers can read from same shard (They all share the 2MB/S read capacity)
# Consumer (Enhanced Fan-Out-Consumer)
    # Subscribe to shard API
    # 2MB/S per consumer/shard
    # Multiple applications for same stream
    # Latency 70
    # Kinesis will push data
    # Max of 5 consumer applications per stream, but u can put a ticket to increase this with AWS
# Consumer (Lambda)
    # GetBatch API
    # Lambda retries
    # up to 10 batches of record per shard simultaneously
