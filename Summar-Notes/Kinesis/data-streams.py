# Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
    # Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a scalable and durable real-time data streaming service that can continuously 
    # capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources. 
    # This is made up of multiple shards
    # This is provisioned during stream creation
    # Data will be split accross all the shards
    # Shards will define stream capacity interms of injestion and consumption rights
    # Producers send data into kinesis data streams
    # Producers us the SDK to produce records, these comprise of a partition key and data blob up to 1MB
    # The partition key determines which shard to send the data to
    # Up to 1MB/s or 1000msg/s per shard
    # 2MB/s per shard for all consumers
    # 2MB/sec enhanced per shard per consumer
    # Data storage (data replay)
    # Real time streaming
# Attributes
    # Data can not be deleted
    # Retension is between 1-365 days
    # Data with same partision key go to same shard for ordering
    # Producers: AWS SDK, Kinesis Producer Library, Kinesis agent
    # Consumers
        # Kinesis client lib
        # Lambda, firehose, analytic
# Capacity Modes
    # Provisioned Mode
        # You choose the number of shards provisioned
        # Each shard gets 1MB/s
        # Each shard gets 2MB/s
    # On-demand mode
        # Managed capacity
        # 4MB/s default capacity
        # Scales automatic
# Secusity
    # IAM policy
    # Encription in flight using HTTPS enspoints
    # Encryption at rest using KMS keys
    # Client side encryption
    # VPC endpoints
    # All API calls can be monitored using cloudTrail
