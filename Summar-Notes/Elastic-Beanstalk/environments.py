# Creating Environment
    # AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy to create new environments for your application. You can create and manage 
    # separate environments for development, testing, and production use, and you can deploy any version of your application 
    # to any environment. Environments can be long-running or temporary. When you terminate an environment, you can save 
    # its configuration to recreate it later.
# Deployment
    # As you develop your application, you will deploy it often, possibly to several different environments for different 
    # purposes. Elastic Beanstalk lets you configure how deployments are performed. You can deploy to all of the instances 
    # in your environment simultaneously, or split a deployment into batches with rolling deployments.
# Configuration
    # Configuration changes are processed separately from deployments, and have their own scope. For example, if you 
    # change the type of the EC2 instances running your application, all of the instances must be replaced. On the other 
    # hand, if you modify the configuration of the environment's load balancer, that change can be made in-place without 
    # interrupting service or lowering capacity. You can also apply configuration changes that modify the instances in 
    # your environment in batches with rolling configuration updates.
# Resource modification
    # Modify the resources in your environment only by using Elastic Beanstalk. If you modify resources using another 
    # service's console, CLI commands, or SDKs, Elastic Beanstalk won't be able to accurately monitor the state of those 
    # resources, and you won't be able to save the configuration or reliably recreate the environment. Out-of band-changes 
    # can also cause issues when updating or terminating an environment.
# Deleting Resources
    # If you need keep resources after terminating your application, create these resources outside beanstalk
