# You can add AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration files (.ebextensions) to your web application's source code 
# to configure your environment and customize the AWS resources that it contains. Configuration files are YAML-
# or JSON-formatted documents with a .config file extension that you place in a folder named .ebextensions and 
# deploy in your application source bundle. Example .ebextensions/network-load-balancer.config. This example 
# makes a simple configuration change. It modifies a configuration option to set the type of your environment's 
# load balancer to Network Load Balancer.
# File must end with .config
# Ability to add resources that can not be added using the CLI
# Set environment variables like connection string and username for RDA or DynamoDB
# Using option_settings section in a configuration file we can customize configuration of a AWS resource natively 
# supported by Elastic Beanstalk.
