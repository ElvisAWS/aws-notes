# HTTPS
    # The simplest way to use HTTPS with an Elastic Beanstalk environment is to assign a server certificate to your 
    # environment's load balancer. When you configure your load balancer to terminate HTTPS, the connection between 
    # the client and the load balancer is secure. Backend connections between the load balancer and EC2 instances use 
    # HTTP, so no additional configuration of the instances is required.
# AWS Certificate Manager
    # With AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you can create a trusted certificate for your domain names for free. ACM 
    # certificates can only be used with AWS load balancers and Amazon CloudFront distributions, and ACM is available 
    # only in certain AWS Regions.
    # Use code: .ebextension/securelistener-alb.config to configure HTTPS during deployment
    #Â You can set up redirection of HTTP-HTTPS to the backend using your ALB or your instances
    # Make sure health checks are not redirected as the request sent should be HTTP and not HTTPS
