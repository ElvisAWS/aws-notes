# Deployment
    # Each deployment is identified by a deployment ID. Deployment IDs start at 1 and increment by one with each 
    # deployment and instance configuration change. If you enable enhanced health reporting, Elastic Beanstalk displays 
    # the deployment ID in both the health console and the EB CLI when it reports instance health status. The deployment 
    # ID helps you determine the state of your environment when a rolling update fails.
# Deployment Modes
    # All at once
        # The quickest deployment method. Suitable if you can accept a short loss of service, and if quick deployments 
        # are important to you. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk deploys the new application version to each instance. 
        # Then, the web proxy or application server might need to restart. As a result, your application might be unavailable 
        # to users (or have low availability) for a short time.
    # Rolling
        # Avoids downtime and minimizes reduced availability, at a cost of a longer deployment time. Suitable if 
        # you can't accept any period of completely lost service. With this method, your application is deployed to your 
        # environment one batch of instances at a time. Most bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment.
    # Rolling with additional batch
        # Avoids any reduced availability, at a cost of an even longer deployment time compared to the Rolling method. 
        # Suitable if you must maintain the same bandwidth throughout the deployment. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk 
        # launches an extra batch of instances, then performs a rolling deployment. Launching the extra batch takes time, 
        # and ensures that the same bandwidth is retained throughout the deployment.
    # Immutable
        # A slower deployment method, that ensures your new application version is always deployed to new instances, instead 
        # of updating existing instances. It also has the additional advantage of a quick and safe rollback in case the 
        # deployment fails. With this method, Elastic Beanstalk performs an immutable update to deploy your application. In 
        # an immutable update, a second Auto Scaling group is launched in your environment and the new version serves traffic 
        # alongside the old version until the new instances pass health checks.
    # Traffic splitting
        # A canary testing deployment method. Suitable if you want to test the health of your new application version 
        # using a portion of incoming traffic, while keeping the rest of the traffic served by the old application version.
    # Blue Green
        # Not a direct feature of Beanstalk
        # Zero downtime and release facility
        # Creates a new stage and deploys you new environment
        # The new environment (Green) can be validated and rolled back independently
        # Route 53 can be setup using weighted policies to redirect a little bit of traffic to the stage environment
        # using Beanstalk, swap Urls when done with the environment to test
