# After creating an Elastic beanstalk env, you cannnot change the ALB(CLB-ALB) type only its configuration
# Migration
    # Create new environment with same configuration but with the ALB as the CLB can not be cloned
    # Cloning the old env with clone the CLB and thats not what you want
    # Deploy your application to a new env
    # Do a CNAME swap or Route 53 to change DNS
    # Always seperate your RDS from your beanstalk
