# Hooks
    # The content in the 'hooks' section of the AppSpec file varies, depending on the compute platform for your 
    # deployment. The 'hooks' section for an EC2/On-Premises deployment contains mappings that link deployment 
    # lifecycle event hooks to one or more scripts. The 'hooks' section for a Lambda or an Amazon ECS deployment 
    # specifies Lambda validation functions to run during a deployment lifecycle event.
    # EC2/On-Premis Hooks
        # ApplicationStop
            # This deployment lifecycle event occurs even before the application revision is downloaded. You can 
            # specify scripts for this event to gracefully stop the application or remove currently installed packages 
            # in preparation for a deployment. The AppSpec file and scripts used for this deployment lifecycle event 
            # are from the previous successfully deployed application revision.
        # DownloadBundle
            # During this deployment lifecycle event, the CodeDeploy agent copies the application revision files 
            # to a temporary location:
            # /opt/codedeploy-agent/deployment-root/deployment-group-id/deployment-id/deployment-archive folder 
            # on Amazon Linux, Ubuntu Server, and RHEL Amazon EC2 instances.
        # BeforeInstall
            # You can use this deployment lifecycle event for preinstall tasks, such as decrypting files and creating 
            # a backup of the current version.
        # Install
            # During this deployment lifecycle event, the CodeDeploy agent copies the revision files from the temporary 
            # location to the final destination folder. This event is reserved for the CodeDeploy agent and cannot be 
            # used to run scripts.
        # AfterInstall
            # You can use this deployment lifecycle event for tasks such as configuring your application or changing 
            # file permissions.
        # ApplicationStart
            # You typically use this deployment lifecycle event to restart services that were stopped during ApplicationStop.
        # ValidateService 
            # This is the last deployment lifecycle event. It is used to verify the deployment was completed successfully.
    # Lambda 
        # An AWS Lambda hook is one Lambda function specified with a string on a new line after the name of the lifecycle 
        # event. Each hook is executed once per deployment. Here are descriptions of the hooks available for use in your 
        # AppSpec file.
        # BeforeAllowTraffic 
            # Use to run tasks before traffic is shifted to the deployed Lambda function version.
        # AfterAllowTraffic 
            # Use to run tasks after all traffic is shifted to the deployed Lambda function version.
    # ECS
        # BeforeInstall
            # Use to run tasks before the replacement task set is created. One target group is associated with the original 
            # task set. If an optional test listener is specified, it is associated with the original task set. A rollback 
            # is not possible at this point.
        # AfterInstall 
            # Use to run tasks after the replacement task set is created and one of the target groups is associated with 
            # it. If an optional test listener is specified, it is associated with the original task set. The results of a 
            # hook function at this lifecycle event can trigger a rollback.
        # AfterAllowTestTraffic 
            # Use to run tasks after the test listener serves traffic to the replacement task set. The results of a 
            # hook function at this point can trigger a rollback.
        # BeforeAllowTraffic 
            # Use to run tasks after the second target group is associated with the replacement task set, but before traffic 
            # is shifted to the replacement task set. The results of a hook function at this lifecycle event can trigger a 
            # rollback.
        # AfterAllowTraffic 
            # Use to run tasks after the second target group serves traffic to the replacement task set. The results of a 
            # hook function at this lifecycle event can trigger a rollback.
