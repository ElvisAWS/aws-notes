# CodeDeploy rolls back deployments by redeploying a previously deployed revision of an application as a new 
# deployment. These rolled-back deployments are technically new deployments, with new deployment IDs, rather 
# than restored versions of a previous deployment.
# Deployments can be rolled back automatically or manually.
    # Rollback and redeployment workflow
        # When automatic rollback is initiated, or when you manually initiate a redeployment or manual rollback, 
        # CodeDeploy first tries to remove from each participating instance all files that were last successfully 
        # installed. CodeDeploy does this by checking the cleanup file
    # Rollback behavior with existing content
        # As part of the deployment process, the CodeDeploy agent removes from each instance all the files installed 
        # by the most recent deployment. If files that weren’t part of a previous deployment appear in target deployment 
        # locations, you can choose what CodeDeploy does with them during the next deployment:
            # Fail the deployment — An error is reported and the deployment status is changed to Failed.
            # Overwrite the content — The version of the file from the application revision replaces the version 
            # already on the instance.
            # Retain the content — The file in the target location is kept and the version in the application revision 
            # is not copied to the instance.
