# Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service in AWS that is designed to give developers and businesses 
# an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names 
# like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. 
# Route 53 reduces the complexity and operational overhead of DNS management and allows you to focus on building 
# your applications instead of managing a complex DNS infrastructure yourself.
