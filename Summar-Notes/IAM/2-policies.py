# A policy is an entity in AWS that when attached to an identity or resource, permissions are being defined
# A policy contains different permissions that determine if the request is allowed or denied
# They are stored in AWS as Json documents
# They are attached to principles or resources
# There are several types of Policies
    # Identity based #
        # Policies you can attach to a principle
        # They control what actions an identity can perform on what resources and under what conditions
        # There are of two types Managed and Inline policies
            # Managed Policies : AWS Managed, Customer Managed
            # Inline: A policy created and embedded onto a principle
    # Resource based #
        # Policies that you can attach to a resource such as S3 bucket
        # They control what actions a principle can perform on what resources and under what conditions
        # They are only inline and no managed resource based policies
    # Access control lists (ACLs) #
        # Access control lists (ACLs) are service policies that allow you to control which principals in another 
        # account can access a resource. ACLs cannot be used to control access for a principal within the same 
        # account. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does 
        # not use the JSON policy document format. Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC are examples of services 
        # that support ACLs.

# Permissions Boundary #
    # Assume that the IAM user named ShirleyRodriguez should be allowed to manage only Amazon S3, Amazon 
    # CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2. To enforce this rule, you can use the following policy to set the permissions 
    # boundary for the ShirleyRodriguez user:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "cloudwatch:*",
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

# The following example policy expands on the previous example. It allows a user to attach only the managed 
# policies that include the path /TEAM-A/ to only the user groups and roles that include the path /TEAM-A/

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "iam:AttachGroupPolicy",

      "arn:aws:iam::account-id:group/TEAM-A/*",
      "arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/TEAM-A/*"
    ],
    "Condition": {"ArnLike": 
      {"iam:PolicyARN": "arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/TEAM-A/*"}
    }
  }
}

# If a policy includes multiple statement, AWS applies a "logical OR" across the statements at evaluation time.

# Policy evaluation logic #
    # Assume that a principal sends a request to AWS to access a resource in the same account as the principal's 
    # entity. The AWS enforcement code decides whether the request should be allowed or denied. AWS evaluates all 
    # policies that are applicable to the request context. The following is a summary of the AWS evaluation logic 
    # for policies within a single account.
        # By default, all requests are implicitly denied with the exception of the AWS account root user, which has full access.
        # An explicit allow in an identity-based or resource-based policy overrides this default.
        # If a permissions boundary, Organizations SCP, or session policy is present, it might override the allow with an implicit deny.
        # An explicit deny in any policy overrides any allows.
    # Explicit Deny => Explicit Allow => Default Deny
