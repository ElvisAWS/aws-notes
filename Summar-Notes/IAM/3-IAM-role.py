# IAM Roles #
    # An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM 
    # role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what 
    # the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a 
    # role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Also, a role does not have standard long-term 
    # credentials such as a password or access keys associated with it. Instead, when you assume a role, it 
    # provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.
    # You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access 
    # to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources 
    # they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you 
    # might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resources, but not want to embed AWS keys within the app 
    # (where they can be difficult to rotate and where users can potentially extract them). Sometimes you want 
    # to give AWS access to users who already have identities defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate 
    # directory. Or, you might want to grant access to your account to third parties so that they can perform 
    # an audit on your resources.
    # For these scenarios, you can delegate access to AWS resources using an IAM role. This section introduces 
    # roles and the different ways you can use them, when and how to choose among approaches, and how to create, 
    # manage, switch to (or assume), and delete roles.

    # Temporary security credentials are created for the IAM role
    # Users, AWS services that do not have access to AWS resources and applications can assume this role
    # Users ofone account can be given roles to other accounts
    # You assume an IAM role by calling the AWS Security Token Service (STS) Assume role API ie AssumeRole, 
    # AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity and AssumeRoleWithSaml. These API's return temporary security credentials that 
    # applications can then use to sigm request to AWS service API's.
    # Only one role per instance
    # A role can be assigned to a running EC2 instance or upon lunch.
