# Credential provider chain
    # All SDKs have a series of places (or sources) that they check in order to find valid credentials to use to 
    # make a request to an AWS service. After valid credentials are found, the search is stopped. This systematic 
    # search is called the default credential provider chain. Although the distinct chain used by each SDK varies, 
    # they most often include sources such as the following:
        # Static credentials (such as AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID).
        # Web identity token from AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS).
        # AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On).
        # Trusted entity provider (such as AWS_ROLE_ARN). 
        # Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) credentials.
        # Custom credential provider.
        # Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance profile credentials (IMDS credential provider).
    # The CLI will look for credentials in this Order
        # Command line options
        # Environment variables
        # CLI credential file
        # CLI configuration file
        # Container credentials for ECS
        # Instance profile for EC2
