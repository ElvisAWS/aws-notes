# Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from an encoded message returned 
# in response to an AWS request. The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can 
# contain privileged information that the user who requested the operation should not see. To decode an 
# authorization status message, a user must be granted permissions through an IAM policy to request the 
# DecodeAuthorizationMessage (sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage) action.
