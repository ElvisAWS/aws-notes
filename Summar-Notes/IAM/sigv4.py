# How Signature Version 4 works
    # Create a canonical request.
    # Use the canonical request and additional metadata to create a string for signing.
    # Derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. Then use the signing key, and the string from the previous 
    # step, to create a signature.
    # Add the resulting signature to the HTTP request in a header or as a query string parameter.
    # When an AWS service receives the request, it performs the same steps that you did to calculate the signature 
    # you sent in your request. AWS then compares its calculated signature to the one you sent with the request. 
    # If the signatures match, the request is processed. If the signatures don't match, the request is denied.
