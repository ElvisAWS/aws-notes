# The Fanout Pattern
    # this is when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Kinesis 
    # Data Firehose delivery streams, Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel 
    # asynchronous processing.
    # Push one message onto an SNS topic and two SQS queues will subscribe to the topic
    # No data loss
    # make sure SQS queue access policy allows for SNS to write
    # We can have both standard and Fifo queues as subcribers
