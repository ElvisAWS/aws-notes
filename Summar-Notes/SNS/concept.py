# Amazon SNS
    # Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers 
    # to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers 
    # by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Clients can subscribe to 
    # the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, 
    # Amazon SQS, AWS Lambda, HTTP, email, mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS).
    # One message and many receivers
    # Producers send messages to a topic
    # Subscribers subscribe to the topic and receive messages
    # up to 12500000 subscriptions per topic
    # Up to 100,000 topic limits
    # We can create both a Standard and Fifo SNS topics
