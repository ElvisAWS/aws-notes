# Lazy loading
    # Application requests data from elastic cache, gets a cache hit and returns the data
    # Application requests data from elastic cache, gets a cache miss. It then makes a read request from the 
    # data-base. It then writes the data back in the cache. This means three network calls causing latency to
    # users. During cache hit, you might get stale data.
# Write through
    # Application requests data from elastic cache, gets a cache hit and returns the data
    # Application receives a write request and writes through DB and elastc cache
    # Cache data is never stale
    # Writing data to elastic cache can become huge, use Time-To-Live to delete cached data
