# WebSocket
    # In API Gateway you can create a WebSocket API as a stateful frontend for an AWS service (such as Lambda or 
    # DynamoDB) or for an HTTP endpoint. The WebSocket API invokes your backend based on the content of the 
    # messages it receives from client apps.
    # Unlike a REST API, which receives and responds to requests, a WebSocket API supports two-way communication 
    # between client apps and your backend. The backend can send callback messages to connected clients.
    # In your WebSocket API, incoming JSON messages are directed to backend integrations based on routes that 
    # you configure. (Non-JSON messages are directed to a $default route that you configure.)
    # A route includes a route key, which is the value that is expected once a route selection expression 
    # is evaluated. The routeSelectionExpression is an attribute defined at the API level. It specifies a 
    # JSON property that is expected to be present in the message payload.
    # For example, if your JSON messages contain an action property, and you want to perform different actions 
    # based on this property, your route selection expression might be ${request.body.action}. Your routing 
    # table would specify which action to perform by matching the value of the action property against the 
    # custom route key values that you have defined in the table.
    # There are three predefined routes that can be used: $connect, $disconnect, and $default. In addition, 
    # you can create custom routes.

# Route selection expressions
    # A route selection expression is evaluated when the service is selecting the route to follow for an 
    # incoming message. The service uses the route whose routeKey exactly matches the evaluated value. 
    # If none match and a route with the $default route key exists, that route is selected. If no routes 
    # match the evaluated value and there is no $default route, the service returns an error. For 
    # WebSocket-based APIs, the expression should be of the form $request.body.{path_to_body_element}
{
    "service" : "chat",
    "action" : "join",
    "data" : {
        "room" : "room1234"
   }
}

    # You might want to select your API's behavior based on the action property. In that case, you might 
    # define the following route selection expression:
        # $request.body.action
