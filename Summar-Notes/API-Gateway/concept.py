# API Gateway
    # API Gateway is an AWS service that supports the following
        # Creating, deploying, and managing a RESTful application programming interface (API) to expose backend 
        # HTTP endpoints, AWS Lambda functions, or other AWS services.
        # Creating, deploying, and managing a WebSocket API to expose AWS Lambda functions or other AWS services.
        # Invoking exposed API methods through the frontend HTTP and WebSocket endpoints.
    # API deployment
        # A point-in-time snapshot of your API Gateway API. To be available for clients to use, the deployment must 
        # be associated with one or more API stages.
    # API stage
        # A logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API (for example, 'dev', 'prod', 'beta', 'v2'). API 
        # stages are identified by API ID and stage name.
        # Stages can be rolled back as deployment history is kept
    # Integration request
        # The internal interface of a WebSocket API route or REST API method in API Gateway, in which you map the 
        # body of a route request or the parameters and body of a method request to the formats required by the 
        # backend.
    # Integration response
        # The internal interface of a WebSocket API route or REST API method in API Gateway, in which you map the 
        # status codes, headers, and payload that are received from the backend to the response format that is 
        # returned to a client app.
    # Mapping template
        # A script in Velocity Template Language (VTL) that transforms a request body from the frontend data format 
        # to the backend data format, or that transforms a response body from the backend data format to the frontend 
        # data format. Mapping templates can be specified in the integration request or in the integration response. 
        # They can reference data made available at runtime as context and stage variables.
    # Method request
        # The public interface of an API method in API Gateway that defines the parameters and body that an app 
        # developer must send in requests to access the backend through the API.
    # Method response
        # The public interface of a REST API that defines the status codes, headers, and body models that an 
        # app developer should expect in responses from the API.
    # Mock integration
        # In a mock integration, API responses are generated from API Gateway directly, without the need for an 
        # integration backend. As an API developer, you decide how API Gateway responds to a mock integration 
        # request. For this, you configure the method's integration request and integration response to associate 
        # a response with a given status code.
    # Proxy integration
        # A simplified API Gateway integration configuration. You can set up a proxy integration as an HTTP proxy 
        # integration or a Lambda proxy integration. For HTTP proxy integration, API Gateway passes the entire request 
        # and response between the frontend and an HTTP backend. For Lambda proxy integration, API Gateway sends 
        # the entire request as input to a backend Lambda function. API Gateway then transforms the Lambda function 
        # output to a frontend HTTP response. In REST APIs, proxy integration is most commonly used with a proxy 
        # resource, which is represented by a greedy path variable (for example, {proxy+}) combined with a 
        # catch-all ANY method.
        # We can not use mapping templates to change either request or response lambda integration
    # API Gateway stage variables
        # You can use API Gateway stage variables to access the HTTP and Lambda backends for different API deployment 
        # stages. You can also use stage variables to pass stage-specific configuration metadata into an HTTP backend 
        # as a query parameter and into a Lambda function as a payload that is generated in an input mapping template.
