# S3 Replication
    # Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are 
    # configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can 
    # replicate objects to a single destination bucket or to multiple destination buckets. The destination buckets 
    # can be in different AWS Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket.
    # To automatically replicate new objects as they are written to the bucket use live replication, such as 
    # Same-Region Replication (SRR) or Cross-Region Replication (CRR). To replicate existing objects to a different 
    # bucket on demand, use S3 Batch Replication.
    # To replicate delete marker, delete marker replication must be enabled
