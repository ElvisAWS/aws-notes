# If versioning is enabled re-uploading a file adds a new version
# All files will have a null version if versioning is enabled after the files were uploaded
# Versioning helps in accidental deletes by creating a delete marker
# Deleting the specified objects adds delete markers to them
# (If you need to undo the delete action, you can delete the delete markers.)
