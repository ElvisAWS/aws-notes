# MFA delete
    # When working with S3 Versioning in Amazon S3 buckets, you can optionally add another layer of security by configuring 
    # a bucket to enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) delete. When you do this, the bucket owner must include two forms 
    # of authentication in any request to delete a version or change the versioning state of the bucket.
    # MFA delete requires additional authentication for either of the following operations:
        # Changing the versioning state of your bucket
        # Permanently deleting an object version
    # You will need MFA delete to do the following ( This is when its been enabled or else you can delete it using the command line)
        # Permanently delete an object version
        # Suspend versioning on a bucket
    # Only the bucket owner can enable/disable MFA-Delete
    # To enable MFA delete, you can only use the CLI, its disabled on the UI
