# To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon 
# S3 Lifecycle. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a 
# group of objects. There are two types of actions:
    # Transition actions
        # These actions define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, 
        # you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them, or 
        # archive objects to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class one year after creating them. 
        # There are costs associated with lifecycle transition requests. 
    # Expiration actions
        # These actions define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
        # Lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects.
