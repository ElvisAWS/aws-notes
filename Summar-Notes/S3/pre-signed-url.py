# Pre-signed-url
    # By default, all S3 objects are private. Only the object owner has permission to access them. However, the 
    # object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL, using their own security 
    # credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.
    # When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials and then specify 
    # a bucket name, an object key, an HTTP method (GET to download the object), and an expiration date and time. 
    # The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration. If you created a presigned URL using a 
    # temporary token, then the URL expires when the token expires, even if the URL was created with a later 
    # expiration time.
    # Default time is 3600 secods or 1 hour
