# All the resources you require in an application can be deployed easily using templates. Also, you can reuse your 
# templates to replicate your infrastructure in multiple environments. To make templates reusable, use the parameters, 
# mappings and conditions sections in the template so that you can customize your stacks when you create them.
    # Create a new template or use an existing CloudFormation template using the JSON or YAML format.
    # Save your code template locally or in an S3 bucket.
    # Use AWS CloudFormation to build a stack on your template.
    # AWS CloudFormation constructs and configures the stack resources that you have specified in your template.
